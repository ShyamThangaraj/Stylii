Ok so, pitch:

- show photo from r/malelivingspace as "problem"
- marketing to college students / young adults because (1) they have the least experience with buying interior design stuff, so less comfortable with it--we can make it more
- affiliate links


Can we use nb to generate a 360 degree panoramic image?

We need:
- mobile web app that allows taking a picture
- database of products, including images, links, dimensions


workflow:
-

pitch:
- we're improving the experience for purchasing from amazon/ebay/ikea/etc
- young adults (college students, etc) have little experience with decorating/furnishing. Consequence: spend more money and time than they needed to and/or end up with a less than optimal setup; or, no personalization [r/malelivingspace pic]
- young adults like using new stuff like ai
- we can transform the shopping experience

- could expand with affiliate links

- profit opportunity: we can have sponsored results, a la google search, maps, etc.
